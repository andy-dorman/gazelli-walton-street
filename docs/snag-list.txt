- The piece of text begining 'Walton Street Sw3 is about to…' has too much padding left & tight. Needs to stretch across the whole column.

 - Set Your Goal should be a roll over button which brings up the form.

 - All the vertical spacing needs to be tightened up. So;
	- Top key a little closer to the top
	- DREAM LIVE LEARN a touch closer to the key
	- 'WALTON STREET'S NEWEST SECRET…' a little closer to DREAM LIVE LEARN
	- White paragraph is ok vertically
	- Lines around 'SET YOUR GOAL| need to be tighter and the words need to be centred.

- All the initials in the keys are not in the centre of the little circle. Need to be higher.

 - On the pink 'shelf' block, I like the spacing of the words 'My goal is to' but the learning of the actual goal text (Retire at 45 etc) is far too relaxed.

- Would be nice to see the image in the back ground - adding a drop shadow to the grey content area so it floats off the floral background.

- As discussed yesterday, I would always like there to be a minimum of 4 grey 'shadow' keys at the bottom, and the second row up is half empty (spending on how many entries there are)

- The first 'LOCK IN YOUR OWN GOAL' should be the deeper claret red colour as per the drawing.

- I would like to repeat the 'Lock in your own goal' on the very last space of the grid - I guess this one will have to move along every time a goal is entered. (remembering there should always be a minimum of 4 grey key shadowed boxes at the end.

 - Grey shadowed keys look very low resolution and there are strange 'shadows' in the grey.

 - The lines in the key grid do not have highlights all the way along. And some of the lines are upside down - horizontal lines; the shadow line should always be at the top and the highlight line should be at the bottom (as if the light is coming from above.
Verticle lines; I guess the shadow line should be on the left, with the highlight line on the right (as off the light is coming from top left.

'Site Details and Terms & Conditions should be a bit smaller.
